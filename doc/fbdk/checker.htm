</CENTER>
<P>This Java&trade; application, supplied with the <A
	HREF="index.htm" TARGET="_top">FBDK</A> download, can be used to check
for compliance of XML files with the <A
	HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/xml/index.htm" TARGET="_blank">DTDs</A>
(Document Type Definitions) specified in <A
	HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/stds/iec/sc65bwg7tf3/html/news.htm"

<H3>Instructions</H3>
<OL>
	<LI>Run the <TT>checker.jar</TT> file in the FBDK home directory
	by double-clicking on its icon or selecting the <B>Open</B> option from
	its pop-up menu (or the equivalent operation for Linux&reg;).</LI>
	<LI>The <B>XMLChecker</B> application will check the contents of
	all the files in the <TT>src</TT> subdirectory of the directory in
	which it is installed, and recursively check the contents of all
	subdirectories of the <TT>src</TT> subdirectory.</LI>
	<LI>If a file with non-compliant contents is found, the
	application will open a dialog box identifying the path to the file and
	the line and column numbers where the error was found.</LI>
	<LI>The error can generally be fixed by opening the file with the
	<A HREF="index.htm" TARGET="_top">FBDK</A> and re-saving it as XML.</LI>
	<LI>Once the error has been fixed, the scan of files can be
	re-started from the beginning by closing the dialog box and clicking on
	the application's <B>Restart</B> button.</LI>
	<LI>If no files are found with errors, the application will
	display a dialog box indicating a successful completion of the scan.</LI>
