<H3>Adding a State to an ECC</H3>
<P>You can add a state to an ECC by using the <B>New Action</B> item of
the ECC workspace's popup menu (the menu that you get by clicking the
right mouse button on an empty area of the workspace).</P>
<H3>Deleting a State</H3>
<P>You can delete a state from an ECC by using the <B>Delete</B> option
of its popup menu or by using the <B>Alt+Del</B> keychord. Since this
will also delete all transitions to or from the state, a dialog box will
pop up to give you a chance to cancel this action.</P>
<H3>The EC State Dialog</H3>
<P>You can use this dialog both for adding a new state to an ECC or for
editing an existing state. You invoke it by clicking the "Add State"
popup menu item of an ECC, or by double-clicking an existing EC state or
clicking the "Edit" item of its popup menu..</P>

<P>You can use the "Initial State" checkbox to request that the state be
made the initial state of the ECC, i.e., the first in the list of
states.</P>
<P ALIGN="center"><IMG SRC="state2.gif" ALIGN="bottom" BORDER="0"

<P>You can close the dialog without making any changes to the state by
pressing the "Cancel" button or the <IMG SRC="close.png" ALIGN="middle">
in the upper right corner of the dialog. If you press the "OK" button,
and no errors are detected, the requested changes (if any) will be made
and the dialog will close. If an error is detected when you press the
"OK" button, the dialog does not close and an error message appears at
the top line of the dialog, for instance:<A NAME="errors"></A></P>
