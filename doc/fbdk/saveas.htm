	<LI>This dialog enables you to save the library element in the current
	FBEditor tab in any of the following formats:</LI>
	<UL>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsXML"></A><B>XML</B>: Saves the current library
		element in an IEC 61499 XML encoded file.</LI>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsJava"></A><B>Java</B>: Saves the current
		library element as a <TT>*.java</TT> file and compiles it to a <TT>*.class</TT>
		file in the same directory. Following compilation, a dialog box will
		open displaying the results of the compilation and the <TT>*.java</TT>
		source file with correspondingly numbered lines.</LI>
		<LI><A NAME="FileSaveAsHTML"></A><B>HTML</B>: Saves the current
		library element as an HTML file containing skeleton documentation for
		the element, including an applet for viewing an XML file containing
		the library element. The size of the applet frame will be the same as
		the current size of the FBEditor frame.</LI>
	</UL>
	<LI>The directory in which the files are saved is determined by the
	package name. For instance, if the FBDK is located in the <TT>C:\fbdk</TT>
	directory, the XML file of the element shown above would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\src\mach\LOAD_CTL.fbt</TT>;
	the HTML file would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\src\mach\LOAD_CTL.htm</TT>;
	and the Java and class files would be stored as <TT>C:\fbdk\lib\fb\rt\mach\LOAD_CTL.java</TT>
	and <TT>C:\fbdk\lib\fb\rt\mach\LOAD_CTL.class</TT>, respectively.</LI>
	<LI>If a file is already saved with the given library element name,
	e.g., <TT>myFBType.java</TT>, it is copied into a backup file, e.g., <TT>myFBType.baknn</TT>,
	where <TT>nn</TT> is the lowest available number in the sequence <TT>{00..99}</TT>.
	<IMG SRC="../note.gif">If all the backup numbers in the sequence <TT>00..99</TT>
	are occupied, no backup will be made, so it is a good idea to <B>purge
	backed up files</B> from time to time.</LI>
