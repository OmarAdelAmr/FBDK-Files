<h3><a name="FBDK"></a>FBDK [<a href="#FBRT">FBRT</a>] [<A HREF="#MVCD">MVCD</A>]</h3>
<ul>
<LI>This is the first maintenance release of the FBDK by <A HREF="http://www.holobloc.com" TARGET="_top">Holobloc, Inc.</A> under license from Rockwell Automation.</LI>
  <li>The FBDK has been tested to work with the J2SE 1.4.2 SDK and the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">J2SE 5.0 SDK</a>, which has a more "modern" look and feel.</li>
<LI><A HREF="launchdlg.htm">Initialization of remote devices</A> now uses the host IP address instead of <TT>localhost</TT> for the management port.</LI>
<LI>Source files in the <TT>src</TT> subdirectory hierarchy have been scanned with the <B>XMLChecker</B> application and updated for compliance with the current <A HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/xml/">XML DTDs</A> defined by <A HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/stds/iec/sc65bwg7tf3/html/news.htm">IEC 61499-2</A>.</LI>
<LI>Implementation of the <B>File Save As HTML</B> option has been updated so that emitted code works better with current JVM implementations.</LI>

</ul>
<h3><a name="FBRT"></a>FBRT [<a href="#FBDK">FBDK</a>] [<a href="#MVCD">MVCD</a>]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The FBRT has been tested to work with the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">J2SE 5.0 SDK</a> and may not work
with earlier versions of the SDK.</li>
  <li>Various details of the FBRT implementation have been modified for future compatibility with the <A HREF="http://java.sun.com/products/cldc/index.jsp">J2ME CLDC</A> profile for embedded devices.</li>
  <li>Errors in the initialization of variables of type <TT>LINT</TT> and <TT>TIME</TT> from strings have been corrected.</li>
  <li>Many small improvements have been made in efficiency of the runtime classes.</li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="MVCD"></a>MVCD [<a href="#FBDK">FBDK</a>] [<a href="#FBRT">FBRT</a>]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The <TT>DRIVE</TT> function block type is no longer used. Its timing function has been replaced by a clock pulse distribution mechanism using <TT>PUBL_0/SUBL_0</TT> blocks, and its motion simulation function has been integrated into models, e.g., <TT><A HREF="../despats/mvc/MECH2_MDL.htm">MECH2_MDL</A></TT>.</li>
