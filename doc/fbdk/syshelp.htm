<BODY>
<H3><A NAME="Create" />Create a New System Configuration</H3>
<P>You can create a new system configuration in the <B>FBEditor</B>
by:</P>
<UL>
	<LI>Opening a file containing an existing system configuration
	(one with a <TT>*.sys</TT> filename); or</LI>
	<LI>Clicking the <B>File =&gt; New =&gt; System</B> menu item.</LI>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="System" />System Diagram</H3>
<P>You open the system diagram for editing by clicking on the
corresponding element with the system name in the navigation tree. On
this diagram you can add, edit and delete <A HREF="#Devices">device
instances</A> as well as <A HREF="#Segments">network segments and links</A>.</P>
<P>The figure below shows the result of opening the system diagram
for the <TT>TEST_NW</TT> example in the <TT>fbdk/src/test</TT>directory
(the examples in this directory are used mostly for regression testing
when changes are made to the FBDK).</P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="TEST_NW.gif"></CENTER>
<H3><A NAME="Devices" />Devices and Resources</H3>
<P>You can add, edit and delete device instances in a system diagram
in the same manner as for FB instances in a <A HREF="fbdfrm.htm">function
block diagram</A>.</P>
<P>You can open <B>devices</B> for editing by clicking on the
corresponding device in the navigation tree.</P>
<P>When a device diagram is open for editing, you can add, edit and
delete <B>resources, FB instances</B> and <B>connections</B> in the
device in the same manner as for devices in a system diagram. However,
you cannot edit or delete resources that are defined as part of the <B>device
type</B>.</P>
<P>You can <A HREF="fbdfrm.htm">edit a resource's function block
diagram</A> in the normal way after opening the diagram for editing by
clicking on the resource in the navigation tree. However, you cannot
edit or delete FB instances that are defined as part of the <B>resource
type</B>.</P>
<H3><A NAME="Segments" />Network Segments and Links</H3>
<P><A
	HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/stds/iec/sc65bwg7tf3/html/news.htm">IEC
Standard 61499-1</A>, published in January 2005, defines a textual syntax
for <B>network segments and links</B> and their <A HREF="params.htm">parameters</A>,
and <A HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/stds/iec/sc65bwg7tf3/html/news.htm">IEC
Standard 61499-2</A>, also published in January 2005, defines a graphic
model and XML syntax for these elements.</P>
<P>This version of the FBDK supports these elements as follows:</P>
<UL>
	<LI><B>Segments</B> are added to the diagram with the <B>New</B>
	item of its popup menu. This pops up a dialog as shown below which lets
	you edit the name, type, length (in hundredths of a text line height)
	and comment of the segment. The name and type are freely editable, and
	any string in the form of an IEC 61131-3 identifier is acceptable as
	long it does not conflict with the names of other objects in the
	diagram. The drop-down list also provides entries for Ethernet,
	ControlNet, DeviceNet, localhost (socket connections on the local
	workstation) and LocalBus (connections using the <A
		HREF="../despats/publsubl/index.htm">local multicast</A> pattern).</LI>
	<P></P>
	<CENTER><IMG SRC="segnew.png"></CENTER>
	<P></P>
	<UL>
		<LI>A segment can be edited by using the <B>Edit</B> item of its
		pop-up menu; this invokes the same dialog as was used for its
		creation.</LI>
		<LI>A segment can be deleted from the diagram by using the <B>Delete</B>
		item of its pop-up menu.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="params.htm">Parameters</A> of a segment are edited
		with a dialog as illustrated below, invoked from the <B>Edit =>
		Parameters</B> item of its pop-up menu. The name of the parameter must
		have the form of an IEC 61131-3 identifier. Parameter values and
		comments are freely editable.</LI>
		<P></P>
		<CENTER><IMG SRC="segedit.gif"></CENTER>
		<P></P>
	</UL>
	<LI>A <B>link</B> can be drawn from a <B>segment</B> to a <B>device</B>
	using the <A HREF="dndconn.htm">Alt+Drag</A> gesture.</LI>
	<UL>
		<LI>A segment can be deleted from the diagram by using the <B>Delete</B>
		item of its pop-up menu.</LI>
		<LI>The comment of the link can be edited using the <B>Edit</B>
		item of its popup menu.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="params.htm">Parameters</A> of a link are edited in a
		similar manner to parameters of a segment, using a dialog invoked from
		the <B>Edit => Parameters</B> item of its pop-up menu.</LI>
	</UL>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="Applications" />Applications</H3>
<UL>
	<LI>You can add an application to a system by using the <B>New
	=> Application</B> item of the popup menu for the <A HREF="#System">system
	diagram</A>. This opens a dialog box in which you can edit the
	application's name and comment.</LI>
	<LI>Once you have created the application's name and comment, you
	can edit them in the <B>Text Area</B> with the <B>XML</B> view turned
	on, and record your changes with the <IMG SRC="parse.gif"><B>Parse</B>
	button.</LI>
	<LI>You can <A HREF="fbdfrm.htm">edit an application's
	function block diagram</A> in the normal way after opening the diagram for
	editing by clicking on the application in the navigation tree.</LI>
</UL>
<H3><A NAME="Mapping" />Mapping</H3>
<P>You can <I>map</I> a <I>function block instance</I> from an <I>application</I>
to a <I>device</I> or <I>resource</I> with the <B>Map</B> item of the
popup menu for the function block instance in its application diagram.
The destination of the mapping operation is chosen from the sub-menu of
the <B>Map</B> item. All feasible <I>event</I> and <I>data
connections</I> are also copied at the same time. Any errors detected during
the mapping operation are displayed in the <A
	HREF="FBEditorHelp.htm#description">Status Line</A>.</P>
<H3>Testing</H3>
<P>See the separate documentation on <A HREF="systest.htm">Testing
System Configurations</A>.
<A NAME="Saving" />
<H3>Saving</H3>
<P>When your editing is complete, save your work with the <A
	HREF="saveas.htm">File=&gt;Save As... dialog</A>.<BR>
<IMG SRC="../note.gif">Of course, it is a good idea to <B>save
your work</B> from time to time while editing, too!</P>
