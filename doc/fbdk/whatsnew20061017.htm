<P><I>This page documents changes since the <A

the FBDK.</I></P>

<H4>Features</H4>
<UL>
	<LI>A <B>Run</B> button has been added to the menu bar to
	facilitate this commonly used operation.</LI>
	<LI>A new template has been added for <A HREF="howtosim.htm">simple
	function block types</A>, which have only a <TT>REQ/CNF</TT> event pair and
	a single algorithm to be executed.</LI>
	<LI>The <A HREF="fbdalg.htm">functional programming</A> paradigm
	has been adopted for efficient runtime execution of algorithms in the
	IEC 61131-3 FBD language:
	<UL>
		<LI>Algorithms in the FBD language are restricted to use only
		"pure" IEC 61131-3 <I>functions</I>, which have a single output and no
		internal state.</LI>
		<LI>A new file type "<TT>*.fnt</TT>" and icon <IMG SRC="ft16.gif">
		are added for <I>function templates</I>, which are used for generation
		of code corresponding to IEC 61131-3 functions in FBD algorithms.</LI>
		<LI>"Stateful" IEC 61131-3 function block types (<TT>CTU</TT>,
		etc.) and functions with multiple outputs (<TT>DIV_INT</TT>, etc.)
		have been removed from the FBDK library.</LI>
		<LI><A HREF="funsub.htm">IEC 61499 equivalents</A> may be
		substituted for the removed types, e.g., <TT>E_CTU</TT> for <TT>CTU</TT>
		and <TT>FB_DIV_INT</TT> for <TT>DIV_INT</TT>.</LI>
		<LI><IMG SOURCE="../note.gif">Basic function blocks with
		FBD algorithms using the removed function block types may not load and
		will not compile correctly, and may have to be edited in raw XML form
		to remove the obsolete function block types.</LI>
	</UL>
	</LI>
	<LI>Comparison, selection and string function blocks have been
	given their own folders (<TT>compare, select</TT> and <TT>strings</TT>,
	respectively).</LI>
	<LI>Items have been added to the <B>Help</B> menu for the <A
		HREF="http://groups.google.com/group/fbdk/" TARGET="_blank">FBDK
	Discussion Group</A> and <A
		HREF="http://www.holobloc.com/doc/fbdk/index.htm" TARGET="_top">this
	download area</A>.</LI>

<UL>
	<LI>Real-time performance of output event dispatching has been
	improved.</LI>
	<LI>Real-time performance of "Simple" function blocks (<TT>FB_AND</TT>,
	etc) has been improved.</LI>
	<LI>Real-time performance of algorithms written in the IEC 61131-3
	FBD language has been significantly improved with the <A
		HREF="fbdalg.htm">functional programming</A> paradigm.</LI>
	<LI>Real-time performance of algorithms written in the IEC 61131-3
	LD language has been improved through use of the Java&trade;
	conditional Boolean operators <TT>&amp;&amp;</TT> and <TT>||</TT> in
	generated code.</LI>
	<LI>Real-time performance and memory requirements of many
	event-handling blocks have been improved.</LI>
