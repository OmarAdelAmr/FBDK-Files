<h3><a name="FBDK"></a>FBDK [<a href="#FBRT">FBRT</a>] [<A HREF="#MVCD">MVCD</A>]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The FBDK has been tested to work with the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">J2SE 5.0 SDK</a>, which has a more "modern" look and feel. The FBDK may also work with the J2SE 1.4.2 SDK.</li>
<LI><A HREF="custom.htm">Customization</A> procedures have been simplified.</LI>
<LI>Graphical editing of <A HREF="syshelp.htm#Segments">network segments and links</A> is now possible in system configuration diagrams.</LI>
<LI>The new style of representing <A HREF="params.htm">parameters</A> as parenthesized assignment lists is now supported.</LI>
<LI>Graphical editing of <A HREF="seqs.htm">service sequences</A> is now supported.</LI>
  <li><B>XML Parsing Only</B></li>
  <UL>
    <LI>Due to increasing complexities in the source format introduced by the new features described above, only parsing of XML-formatted source text is now supported.</LI>
<LI>Reading of <TT>*.src</TT> files is no longer supported.</LI>
<LI>Parsing of text from the <B>Source</B> view is no longer supported. </LI>
</UL>
</ul>
<h3><a name="FBRT"></a>FBRT [<a href="#FBDK">FBDK</a>] [<a href="#MVCD">MVCD</a>]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>The FBRT has been tested to work with the <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/j2se/">J2SE 1.4.2 SDK</a> and may not work
with earlier versions of the SDK.</li>
  <li>HMI classes formerly located in the <tt>fb.rt.hmi</tt> package
have been converted to the Java 2 <a
 href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/tutorial/uiswing/learn/index.html">Swing</a>
GUI and are now located in the<tt> fb.rt.swing</tt> package; however,
IEC 61499 source code for these classes is still located in the <tt>fbdk/src/hmi</tt>
folder.</li>
  <li>Internal implementation of the abstract superclass <tt>(fb.rt.FBInstance)
    </tt>of all FB types has been changed; you should <b>re-generate
and </b><b>recompile </b>all library elements you have previously
created (use the&nbsp; <b>File=&gt;SaveAs=&gt;Java</b> menu item).</li>
  <li>Internal implementation of the <tt>fb.rt.net</tt> classes has
been changed to provide "pluggable" presentation protocols. This will
not affect you unless you have subclassed these communication service
interfaces.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
<h3><a name="MVCD"></a>MVCD [<a href="#FBDK">FBDK</a>] [<a href="#FBRT">FBRT</a>]</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Substantial improvements and additions have been made to the <a
 href="../despats/mvc/index.htm">MVCD framework</a>.</li>
  <li>Process control and sortation/inspection applications have been
incorporated into the framework and a new pallet handling example has
been added.<br>
  </li>
</ul>
