		<P><I>This page documents changes since the <A

		of the FBDK.</I></P>

		<H4>Features</H4>
		<UL>
			<LI>Launching is again done via the <TT>fbeditor.bat</TT> file
			to allow for differences in JDK&trade; implementations.</LI>
			<LI><B>XML/src</B> selection has been changed from radio buttons
			to tabs, and the <B>Parse/Revert</B> functions have been moved to the
			<B>File</B> menu.</LI>
			<LI>Shortcut buttons have been added to the menu bar for the
			most often used File menu items.</LI>
			<LI><B>Move Up/Down</B> buttons have been added to the menu bar.</LI>
			<LI>A <B>Close current tab</B> button has been added at the
			right of the menu bar.</LI>
			<LI><B>File Save As</B> functions are consolidated into a single
			<A HREF="saveas.htm">File Save</A> dialog box, with all file
			locations determined by package name.</LI>
			<LI>Automatic file backup is added to the <A HREF="saveas.htm">File
			Save</A> function.</LI>
			<LI>A popup menu is now provided for adding variables to
			structured <A HREF="howtodtp.htm">data types</A>.</LI>
			<LI>A file chooser has been added to dialogs for editing <A
				HREF="dlgfb.htm">FB</A>, device and resource instances and
			variables, to simplify the adding of new types.</LI>
			<LI>When doing System configurations, it is now possible to add
			and edit FB instances and connections in Resources which come from
			Device types. This feature was not previously supported; FBNetwork
			elements could only be added and edited in Resources which were added
			to the Device instances as part of the System configuration.</LI>
			<LI>The <TT>path</TT> parameter is no longer used in the <A
				HREF="custom.htm#ini">editor.ini</A> file; both source and object
			code hierarchies are derived from the <TT>src</TT> directory
			hierarchy.</LI>
			<LI>Documentation has been updated, reorganized and expanded.</LI>
		</UL>
		<H4>Bug fixes</H4>
		<UL>
			<LI>A bug in parsing of FBNetworks in Device instances was found
			and fixed.</LI>
			<LI>FBNetworks contained in Resources inside Device Types are
			now correctly generated by the <A HREF="saveas.htm">File Save as
			Java</A> operation.</LI>
			<LI>The upper value of <TT>UDINT</TT> variables was incorrectly
			set to <TT>2<SUP>31</SUP>-1</TT>; it is now correctly set to <TT>2<SUP>32</SUP>-1</TT>
			and an <TT>ADD_UDINT</TT> is provided in <TT>src/plc/math</TT> for
			checking this.</LI>
			<LI><A HREF="dndconn.htm">Drag and drop</A> connection to an
			input variable which is already connected to a <A HREF="params.htm">parameter</A>
			is now recognized as an error and disallowed.</LI>
			<LI>A number of errors in generation of Java code for Device and
			Resource types have been corrected.</LI>
		</UL>

		<H3><A NAME="FBRT"></A>FBRT [<A HREF="#FBDK">FBDK</A>] [<A
			HREF="#MVCD">MVCD</A>]</H3>
		<UL>
			<LI>A new <A HREF="launcher.htm" TARGET="_blank">batch file</A>
			is provided to enable launching of FB instances and system
			configurations independent of the FBEditor application.</LI>
			<LI>Many changes have been made to improve runtime efficiency
			and management. <B>This requires regeneration and recompilation
			of any Java code you may have previously generated for function block
			types, data types, adapter types, resource types or device types.</B></LI>
			<LI>Documentation has been updated, reorganized and expanded.</LI>
		</UL>

		<H3><A NAME="MVCD"></A>MVCD [<A HREF="#FBDK">FBDK</A>] [<A
			HREF="#FBRT">FBRT</A>]</H3>
		<UL>
			<LI>A new <B>Pick and Place</B> example has been added to the <A
				HREF="../despats/mvc/index.htm" TARGET="_blank">MVCD Home Page</A>.
			Interesting new features include new function blocks for mode control
			(<TT>MODE_AMS</TT>) and Boolean input with user-defined graphics (<TT>IMG_BOOL</TT>),
			and a first example of <B>mechatronic design</B>.</LI>
			<LI>A new (and as yet incomplete) HVAC (Heating, Ventilating,
			Air Conditioning) example has been added to the <A
				HREF="../despats/mvc/index.htm" TARGET="_blank">MVCD Home Page</A>.
			An interesting feature is the use of <B>least-squares linear
			regression</B> to smooth noisy input data.</LI>
			<LI><B>See above description of <A HREF="#FBRT">FBRT
			changes</A>.</B></LI>
			<LI>Documentation has been updated, reorganized and expanded.</LI>
